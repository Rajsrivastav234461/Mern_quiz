 Environment Setup
Backend Configuration:

Ensure your backend server is running on http://localhost:5000 or adjust the API URL in the code as needed. The backend should handle authentication and registration.

API Endpoints:

Login Endpoint: POST /api/auth/login
Request Body: { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "yourpassword" }
Response: { "token": "jwt_token_here" }
Registration Endpoint: POST /api/auth/register
Request Body: { "email": "user@example.com", "password": "yourpassword" }
Response: { "message": "User registered successfully" }
Folder Structure
src/components/: Contains the React components.
Login.js: Handles user login.
Register.js: Manages user registration.
TestPage.js: Displays a protected test page.
MCQTestPage.js: Features a multiple-choice quiz.
FinishTestPage.js: Shows a completion message after the test.
src/App.js: Main component managing the applicationâ€™s routing.
src/index.js: Entry point for rendering the application.
public/index.html: HTML template with the root element for React.
Authentication Flow
Login Page (/login):

Users enter their email and password.
On successful login, a JWT token is stored in session storage, and the user is redirected to the /test page.
Failed login attempts trigger an error message.
Registration Page (/register):

Users register by providing an email and password.
Successful registration redirects users to the login page.
Protected Routes:

Access to /test, /mcq-test, and /finish-test requires authentication.
Users without a valid token are redirected to the login page.
Video Background:

The login page includes a video background for a modern user interface.
Deployment
Build the Application:

Create a production build with:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This command generates a build directory with optimized files for deployment.

Deploy:

Deploy the contents of the build directory to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3).

Troubleshooting
Login Issues: Ensure the backend server is running and the API URL is correct. Check for network errors and API responses.
Token Storage: Verify that the token is correctly stored and retrieved from session storage.
Video Issues: Confirm the video URL is valid and the video file is accessible.
